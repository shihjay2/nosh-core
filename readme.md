# NOSH ChartingSystem Installation Instructions

## Preparation:
You'll need to have the following programs installed on your system prior to installation
of NOSH ChartingSystem

##### 1. Apache web server (needs to be running)
##### 2. MySQL database.  Make sure you remember the root password.  This will be asked during the
NOSH ChartingSystem installation. (needs to be running)
##### 3. PHP 5.2 and higher
##### 4. The following PHP modules installed and enabled: 
mysql, imap, mcrypt, imagick, gd, cli, curl, soap, pear
##### 5. PERL
##### 6. Imagemagick
##### 7. PDF ToolKit (pdftk)

## Install the package:
Installing NOSH is very easy.  Like Laravel, NOSH now utilizes [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) to manage its 
PHP dependencies.  Composer is automatically installed when you use the installation script (it is located in /usr/local/bin/composer).

##### 1. Unzip the installation file in a directory of your choice.  Go to the "nosh-cs" directory.
##### 2. Open a terminal window and go to the "nosh-cs" directory.
##### 3. Type "sh install.sh" to run the installation script.
##### 4. Follow the instructions on the prompt.
##### 5. Go to your web browser and type, "http://localhost/nosh" to begin the second stage of
installation.
##### 6. Wait for installation to complete.
##### 7. Login to NOSH ChartingSystem as admin and configure your users and clinic parameters.
It's important to do this first before any other users use NOSH ChartingSystem; otherwise, 
some features such as scheduling will not work correctly!

The installation script automatically adds scheduled task commands (cron files) and web server configuration files to make NOSH 
work seamlessly the first time.  The scrapt also determines if your system meets all the package dependencies before installation.

## Updating the package:
##### 1. Open a terminal window and go to the NOSH installation directory (the default in the script
is /usr/share/nosh).
##### 2. As a root user (sudo in Ubuntu/Debian), type in "sh update.sh" to run the update script.

## Uninstall the package:
##### 1. Open a terminal window and go to the NOSH installation directory (the default in the script
is /usr/share/nosh).
##### 2. As a root user (sudo in Ubuntu/Debian), type "sh uninstall.sh" to run the uninstallation script.

# How the files are organized.

NOSH is built around the Laravel PHP Framework, which is a models/controllers/views (MCV) framework.
Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

## routes
	The routes.php file dictate where the URL command goes to.  Looking at the file, you'll notice that the controllers are
	categorized by an access control list (ACL) based on the type of user priviledges a user has when he/she is logged in to NOSH.
	  
## controllers
	As is standard with the Laravel framework, main guts of the system lie in the ../app/controllers directory.  Looking at the
	routes.php file, you'll notice that the type of controllers are categorized between AJAX and non-AJAX functions (hence they 
	are named with a prefix of Ajax).

## views
	The view files, PDF, and email template files are in the ../app/views directory.  The view files are essentially "modules" that
	are added on depending on the needs of the view layout.
	The corresponding javascript files (named the same as the view file, but with a .js extension) are in the ../public/js directory.

	If you see the javascript, you will notice that jQuery is used heavily here.  There are numerous plugins for jQuery that are 
	referenced in the header file.  Below is a list of the major jQuery plugins that are used:
##### Javascript user interface: JQuery UI (dialog, tabs, accordion, autocomplete)
##### Calendar system: FullCalendar
##### Tables and grids: jqGrid
##### Comment tips: BeautyTips
##### Signature capture: Signature Pad
##### Growth charts: Highcharts
##### Form input masking: Masked Input
##### Date/time input: Time entry

## model
	This is where php code pertaining to MySQL database functions reside.  The controllers frequently point to code in this 
	directory.

## assets
	Images indicated in the view files reside in the ../public/images directory.
	Imported files are usually downloaded via script in the ../import directory.
